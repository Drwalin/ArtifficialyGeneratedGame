Some can be ommited when not applicable.

Never write that some statisitic is 0 or unknown in item json - just ommit this
entry.

If recipee is unknown then just ommit the field. If item has no special effects
then ommit this field as mell. Do the same for special weapon skills. If there
are no requirements for use then ommit that field as well. If no stat bonuses of
damage then ommit that fields as well.


Base stats used in game:
	- str - strength - infuences character HP and STA, determines physical DMG, and carrying capacity
	- dex - dexterity - influences character STA, determines item/weapon/tool handling capability, attacks accuracy, etc.

Some can be ommited when not applicable.

Never write that some statisitic is 0 or unknown in item json - just ommit this
entry.

If recipee is unknown then just ommit the field. If item has no special effects
then ommit this field as mell. Do the same for special weapon skills. If there
are no requirements for use then ommit that field as well. If no stat bonuses of
damage then ommit that fields as well.

Some can be ommited when not applicable.

Never write that some statisitic is 0 or unknown in item json - just ommit this
entry.

If recipee is unknown then just ommit the field. If item has no special effects
then ommit this field as mell. Do the same for special weapon skills. If there
are no requirements for use then ommit that field as well. If no stat bonuses of
damage then ommit that fields as well.


Base stats used in game:
	- str - strength - infuences character HP and STA, determines physical DMG, and carrying capacity
	- dex - dexterity - influences character STA, determines item/weapon/tool handling capability, attacks accuracy, etc.
	- con - constitution - influences character STA, HP, resistance to attacks, poisons, stunt, etc.
	- int - intelligence - determines character MP, spell power, ability to gain knowledge, learn new skills and spells

Fill all places with apropriate values and formats where value starts at '@'.
Some can be ommited when not applicable.

Never write that some statisitic is 0 or unknown in item json - just ommit this
entry.

If recipee is unknown then just ommit the field. If item has no special effects
then ommit this field as mell. Do the same for special weapon skills. If there
are no requirements for use then ommit that field as well. If no stat bonuses of
damage then ommit that fields as well.
