Here's a randomly generated item in the provided JSON format:

Copy code
{
	"name": "Stormcaller",

	"item_usage": "one_hand",
	"item_recipee": [
		"Essence of Lightning",
		"Enchanted Oak Branch",
		"Silver Ingot"

	"dmg": {
		"dmg_physical": 15,

	"stat_bonus": {
		"int": 3,
		"luck": 2,
		"mp": 50
	},
	"usage_requirements": {
		"int": 20
	},
	"weight": 2.5,
	"special_weapon_skils": [
		{
			"name": "Lightning Mastery",
			"description": "Increases lightning damage by 15%."

It requires a significant amount of intelligence to wield effectively and provides bonuses to intelligence, luck, and maximum mana. It also has a special skill called "Lightning Mastery" that enhances its lightning damage further.
