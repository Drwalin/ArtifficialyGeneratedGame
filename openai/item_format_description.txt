	}
}

Fill all places with apropriate values and formats where value starts at '@'.
Some can be ommited when not applicable.

Never write that some statisitic is 0 or unknown in item json - just ommit this
entry.

If recipee is unknown then just ommit the field. If item has no special effects
then ommit this field as mell. Do the same for special weapon skills. If there
are no requirements for use then ommit that field as well. If no stat bonuses of
damage then ommit that fields as well.
